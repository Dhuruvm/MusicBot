## ‚ú® Why MusicMaker?

- **Slash-first UX** ‚Äì `/play`, `/search`, `/language`, `/nowplaying`, and `/help` respond instantly with localized embeds and live-updating buttons.
- **Platform polyglot** ‚Äì Streams from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or a direct MP3/WAV/OGG link. Spotify albums, playlists, and artist radios turn into fully hydrated queues.
- **Adaptive UI** ‚Äì A two-row control deck (Pause, Skip, Stop, Queue, Shuffle, Volume) stays in sync with the audio engine and locks down expired sessions automatically.
- **Edge-ready audio core** ‚Äì Preloads entire queues, heals voice reconnections, and falls back gracefully when Discord or upstream services hiccup.
- **Global voice** ‚Äì 21 fully translated language packs shipped out-of-the-box with instant server switching.
- **Privacy-first** ‚Äì Stores only the language preference per guild in a local JSON database. No chat logs, no audio recordings.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ‚â• 18 (LTS recommended) and npm.
- **Git** for cloning the repository.
- **Discord application** with a bot user created in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- *(Optional but recommended)* A VPS or host with stable bandwidth and low latency to Discord voice regions.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `ffmpeg-static` ships with the project. You do **not** need a system-wide FFmpeg unless you prefer using a custom build.

---

## Quick Start

### Windows fast track

```powershell
# Run from the repo root
.\setup.bat
# Edit the generated .env with your credentials
.\start.bat
```

`setup.bat` verifies Node.js/npm, installs dependencies, and scaffolds a `.env` template if you don‚Äôt have one yet. `start.bat` makes sure your environment is ready and launches the bot via `npm run start`.

### Cross-platform manual steps

```powershell
# 1. Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/umutxyp/musicbot.git discord-musicbot
cd discord-musicbot

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure secrets (see below)
Copy-Item .env .env.backup -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Edit .env with your token, client ID, Spotify credentials, etc.

# 4. Boot the bot
npm run start
# or
node index.js
```

Slash commands register automatically when the bot starts. Guild-scoped deployment executes within seconds if `GUILD_ID` is provided; global rollout can take up to an hour per Discord caching rules.

---

## Configuration

MusicMaker reads from both `config.js` defaults and environment variables via `.env`. Update whichever approach fits your hosting workflow.

### `.env` Cheat Sheet

```dotenv
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
GUILD_ID=optional_guild_for_fast_testing
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=spotify_client_secret
STATUS=üéµ MusicMaker | /play
EMBED_COLOR=#FF6B6B
SUPPORT_SERVER=https://discord.gg/ACJQzJuckW
WEBSITE=https://musicmaker.vercel.app
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discord.token` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.token` | Discord bot token used for login and REST registration. |
| `discord.clientId` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.clientId` | Application ID required to register slash commands. |
| `discord.guildId` | `.env` ‚Üí `config.discord.guildId` | Optional testing guild ID for <1 minute command deployment. Leave blank for global registration. |
| `bot.status` | `.env`/`config.js` | Activity text shown as "Listening to ...". |
| `bot.embedColor` | `.env`/`config.js` | Hex color for all embeds. |
| `bot.supportServer` & `bot.website` | `.env`/`config.js` | Populates help links and README badges. |
| `spotify.clientId` & `spotify.clientSecret` | `.env`/`config.js` | Enables Spotify search, playlist and album expansion. |

> üîê Never commit `.env` to source control. Use deployment secrets in your hosting provider or create environment variables at runtime.

---

## Spotify API Setup

1. Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/), sign in, and click **Create an App**.
2. Name your integration (e.g., `MusicMaker Bot`) and enable **Web API**.
3. Reveal and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Add a redirect URI (any valid URL, e.g., `https://localhost/callback`) ‚Äì although client credentials flow is used, Spotify requires at least one placeholder.
5. Paste both values into your `.env` (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`).
6. Restart the bot. The credentials are cached and refreshed automatically with the client credentials grant.

Without these credentials Spotify requests fall back to zero results.

## Sharding for Large Bots (1000+ Servers)

When your bot reaches **1,000+ servers**, Discord **requires** you to use sharding to distribute the load across multiple processes. MusicMaker includes a fully automated sharding system powered by Discord.js's `ShardingManager`.

> üìö **[Read the complete Sharding Guide](./SHARDING.md)** for detailed documentation, troubleshooting, and best practices.

### üéØ What is Sharding?

Sharding splits your bot into multiple instances (shards), each handling a subset of servers:
- **Shard 0** might handle servers 1-1000
- **Shard 1** might handle servers 1001-2000
- And so on...

Discord automatically routes events to the correct shard based on server ID.

### üöÄ Quick Start with Sharding

#### Option 1: Interactive Launcher (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start.bat
```
Choose option **[2] Sharding Mode** when prompted.

#### Option 2: Direct Sharding Launch
```powershell
.\start-shard.bat
# or
node shard.js
```

#### Option 3: Normal Mode (< 1000 servers)
```powershell
node index.js
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sharding Configuration

Configure sharding in `.env` or `config.js`:

```dotenv
# Sharding Settings
TOTAL_SHARDS=auto              # 'auto' = Discord calculates optimal count
SHARD_LIST=auto                # 'auto' = spawn all shards, or [0,1,2] for specific
SHARD_MODE=process             # 'process' (recommended) or 'worker'
SHARD_RESPAWN=true             # Auto-restart crashed shards
SHARD_SPAWN_DELAY=5500         # Delay between spawning shards (ms)
SHARD_SPAWN_TIMEOUT=30000      # Timeout for shard ready event (ms)
```

### üìä Sharding Modes Explained

| Mode | Description | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **process** | Each shard runs in a separate Node.js process | Production (more stable, isolated memory) |
| **worker** | Each shard runs in a worker thread | Development (less memory, experimental) |

### üî¢ How Many Shards Do I Need?

Discord recommends: **1 shard per 1,000 servers**

| Servers | Recommended Shards |
| --- | --- |
| < 1,000 | No sharding needed (use `node index.js`) |
| 1,000 - 2,000 | 2 shards |
| 2,000 - 3,000 | 3 shards |
| 5,000+ | 5+ shards |

The bot automatically calculates the optimal count when `TOTAL_SHARDS=auto`.

### üìù Sharding Best Practices

1. **Use `auto` for production** ‚Äì Let Discord.js calculate the optimal shard count
2. **Respect spawn delays** ‚Äì Discord rate-limits shard connections (5-5.5 seconds recommended)
3. **Monitor shard health** ‚Äì The shard manager logs each shard's status in real-time
4. **Enable auto-respawn** ‚Äì Crashed shards restart automatically
5. **Use process mode** ‚Äì More stable than worker threads for production

### üîç Monitoring Shards

The bot displays detailed shard information:

```
[SHARD MANAGER] Launching shard 0...
[SHARD 0] ‚úÖ Shard 0 is ready!
[SHARD 0] üéµ Music bot serving 847 servers on this shard!
[SHARD 0] üåê Total servers across all shards: 1523

[SHARD MANAGER] Launching shard 1...
[SHARD 1] ‚úÖ Shard 1 is ready!
[SHARD 1] üéµ Music bot serving 676 servers on this shard!
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Sharding

#### Run Specific Shards
```dotenv
SHARD_LIST=[0,1,2]  # Only spawn shards 0, 1, and 2
```

#### Manual Shard Count
```dotenv
TOTAL_SHARDS=4  # Force 4 shards regardless of server count
```

#### Disable Auto-Respawn (Not Recommended)
```dotenv
SHARD_RESPAWN=false
```

### üö® Important Notes

- **Sharding is mandatory at 1,000+ servers** ‚Äì Discord will reject connections without it
- **Commands work identically** ‚Äì Users see no difference between sharded and non-sharded bots
- **Database remains local** ‚Äì Each shard shares the same `database/languages.json` file
- **Voice connections are isolated** ‚Äì Each shard manages its own voice connections

### üÜò Sharding Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| "Cannot spawn more than X shards" | Discord limits shards based on server count. Use `auto` or contact Discord for limit increase. |
| Shards keep crashing | Check memory usage and increase spawn timeout (`SHARD_SPAWN_TIMEOUT`). |
| Commands not appearing | Wait for all shards to be ready. Global commands can take up to 1 hour to propagate. |
| Bot shows as offline | Ensure all shards are running. Check the shard manager logs. |

---

## Slash Commands & Controls

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/play <query>` | Smart-detects platform links or search keywords, queues playlists/albums, and spins up the control panel. |
| `/search <keywords>` | Presents a paginated selection menu of YouTube matches ‚Äî choose with buttons. |
| `/nowplaying` | Drops the live embed again, including queue status, repeat/shuffle flags, and volume. |
| `/language` | Opens a flag button wall for instant localization (cached per guild). |
| `/help` | Gorgeous, localized feature tour + live stats and support links. |

### On-embed Controls

- **‚è∏Ô∏è / ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Pause & Resume** ‚Äì Auth-limited to DJs, admins, or the original requester.
- **‚è≠Ô∏è Skip** ‚Äì Jumps to the next queued item (requires at least 1 upcoming track).
- **‚èπÔ∏è Stop** ‚Äì Clears queue, tears down voice, and locks the panel.
- **üìã Queue** ‚Äì Renders the next 10 tracks with real-time progress bar.
- **üîÄ Shuffle** ‚Äì Randomizes the queue with guard rails (min. 2 tracks).
- **üîä Volume** ‚Äì Opens a modal allowing 0‚Äì100 input.

All button sessions carry a short-lived signature, preventing stale interactions from previous queues.

## Language Support

Out-of-the-box translations (and matching flag buttons):

**Arabic**, **German**, **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, **Indonesian**, **Italian**, **Japanese**, **Dutch**, **Portuguese**, **Russian**, **Turkish**, **Traditional Chinese**, **Simplified Chinese**, **Hindi**, **Finnish**, **Danish**, **Norwegian**, **Polish**, **Korean**, **Swedish**

Add your own by copying `languages/en.json`, translating strings, and restarting the bot. The `LanguageManager` hot-loads every JSON file in `languages/`.

---

## Deployment Tips

- **Testing Guild** ‚Äì Set `GUILD_ID` during development to avoid the global propagation delay. Remove it before production to reach every server automatically.
- **Process Manager** ‚Äì Use `pm2`, `systemd`, or Docker to keep the bot alive and restart on crashes. Remember to persist the `database/languages.json` file if you containerize.
- **Logging** ‚Äì Leverage the built-in Chalk-colored console output. Redirect stdout/stderr to log files for long-term monitoring.
- **Scaling** ‚Äì The bot maintains one voice connection per guild. Horizontal scaling requires a shared state & queue (Redis, REST API, etc.) ‚Äî future roadmap material.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Slash commands do not appear | Ensure `CLIENT_ID` is correct and the bot logged in successfully. For new deployments, invite the bot with `applications.commands` scope. |
| Spotify tracks return nothing | Verify `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET` and that the app is approved for Spotify Web API. |
| Bot joins but plays silence | Confirm the host has outbound UDP open, and the voice channel permissions allow **Connect** and **Speak**. |
| Buttons stop working mid-song | Interactions expire after Discord‚Äôs cache TTL or when a new session is generated. Use `/play` again to refresh the deck. |
| Command language incorrect | Run `/language`, select your flag, and ensure `database/languages.json` is writable. |
